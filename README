Introduction
============

The aim of the project is to use some kind of clients(e.g. Android) to 
control some kind of home appliance(e.g. Light bulbs). For hardware
setup, a raspberryPi(connected with a USB Wifi and a relay switch) is 
connected to a light switch on the socket.  There is a server running
in the raspberryPi, listening to some commands sending through udp 
packets.  The Android app contains a simple UI create a client to send
udp command depends on the button click.  


GPIO UDP SERVER
===============

gpio_udp_server.c will be compiled on the raspberryPi.  Add the following
lines to the wiringPi Makefile in directory example, then issue command
$ make gio_udp_server

Make commands in the Makefile:
---------------------------------------------------------------
gpio_udp_server: gpio_udp_server.o
        @echo [link]
        @$(CC) -o $@ gpio_udp_server.o $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)
---------------------------------------------------------------



GPIO UDP CLIENT
===============

The client file can be compiled in Linux PC to send command to control
the lights to turn on/off/toggle. Just an alternative way of control or
test.


Android app source code
=======================

Details to build and put files in the right location will have to follow
documentations provided by Android.
